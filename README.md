# Bevor Protocol

Bevor is a decentralized (semi) permission-less protocol and DAO that creates long-lasting incentive structures for audits, which is mutually favorable for all parties involved. This levels the playing field for auditees and auditors as well as improving the incentives, security, and quality of audits. We massively de-risk the financial burden of paying for audits, decentralize the auditing process, and incentivize DAO participation to uncover contract exploits and vulnerabilities.

***In order to test the protocol with mock vesting and DAO proposals:***
